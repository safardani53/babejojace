From slow mornings sipping coffee to hanging out with friends, having a designated outdoor space at your home is a game changer for getting the most out of summer. Whether you’re trying to revamp your outdoor space or make a new one altogether, when choosing outdoor furniture, you have to ask yourself questions that you wouldn’t when buying furniture for other parts of your home. How does this sectional withstand the elements? Is this chair water-resistant? Will these cushions fade easily in the sun? We asked Liz Toombs, certified interior decorator in Lexington, Kentucky, and founder of PDR Interiors, what advice she has for finding the ideal outdoor furniture setup, which according to her, is all about seating.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">"I like to have a mix of seating, such as sofas and chairs with side tables and dining tables and chairs. This allows the patio to be multifunctional when entertaining,” she says. More seating in your outdoor space means more room for entertaining and lounging.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We tested a wide range of outdoor furniture — from modern sectionals to zero gravity chairs — to see how they held up to wind, rain, blazing sun, and, unintentionally (but perhaps most importantly), our pets.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for the best outdoor furniture PEOPLE (and our pets) tested, including an outdoor sectional <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Christina Hall</a> recommended for entertaining large groups.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-value-devoko-wicker-patio-conversation-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Value</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Devoko Wicker Patio Conversation Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1001 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Devoko Patio Porch Furniture Set 3 Pieces PE Rattan Wicker Chairs with Table" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/s5m4Q9Ik0_TOJB7EmOQwLiP6Pn4=/fit-in/1500x1001/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Devoko-Wicker-Patio-Conversation-Set-62ff6e701d7b47fd80e866bd383d43fb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=1.5><li readability=-1><p>The slight curve in the back of the chairs makes these surprisingly supportive.</p></li><li readability=2><p>Even in the rain, the cushions didn’t absorb water, so you don’t have to worry about them getting moldy due to moisture.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The glass top on the table makes it feel extra elegant and sturdy.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Are you looking for chairs to add to your patio setup? This three-piece set is a high-quality and affordable option, so it won our vote for the best value. Despite the low price tag, we were impressed by how high quality it felt. While it’s in no way bulky, the chairs and table feel sturdy and well-made. This is largely due to subtle details, like the glass top on the table, which adds an extra level of stability, especially for drinks. We also loved how supportive and comfortable these chairs felt, thanks to the slight curve in the back of the chairs. While wicker isn’t characteristically known for being super comfortable, we found that we could sit in these chairs for a while without discomfort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We experienced quite a few rainy days during testing. Still, the water-resistant cushions did a great job of allowing most of the moisture to bead down off the surface, which means you won’t have to deal with soggy cushions if you forget to bring them inside ahead of a rainstorm.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The main con we encountered with this set was that, while they are comfortable for wicker chairs, this isn’t the kind of furniture you’ll want to lounge in all day long. You can’t recline, and the set doesn’t include an ottoman, so these are more of the kind of chairs you’d want as a supplement for any patio furniture you already have, or they’d be great on a front porch for your morning coffee or a short visit with a friend. All in all, if you want something inexpensive to finish off your outdoor space, this is a great choice.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Number of Pieces:</strong> 3 | <strong>Material: </strong>PE rattan & polyester fabric and sponge padded cushion</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="Devoko 3-Piece Patio Conversation Set" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/ZxnSKiWzZKf_2sAXj5v-33-gd7k=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-outdoor-funiture-test-devoko-3-pieces-patio-sets-clearance-pe-rattan-wicker-chairs-table-garden-porch-sets-dena-ogden-02-e37ec2f78bf648eba1b9aa27106f60fe.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dena Ogden</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="Devoko 3-Piece Patio Conversation Set" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/oWwtNfwlRHFR5X6SckdDnO3BYmo=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-outdoor-funiture-test-devoko-3-pieces-patio-sets-clearance-pe-rattan-wicker-chairs-table-garden-porch-sets-dena-ogden-03-6b89f0f3efc346758fe5710ccdce2098.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Dena Ogden</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wood-sofa-set-christopher-knight-home-carolina-acacia-outdoor-sofa-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Wood Sofa Set</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Christopher Knight Home Carolina Outdoor Sofa Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Christopher Knight Home Carolina Acacia Outdoor Sofa Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/2mKY6qDFJmXWrztnnMo9-wbwqX8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Christopher-Knight-Home-Carolina-Acacia-Outdoor-Sofa-Set-9c87daca71974912b2deb1216899e095.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=0><p>The wood is resistant to condensation, so you don’t have to worry about damaging moisture.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The cushions repel heat, so your skin won’t get too hot from sitting for too long.</p></li><li readability=1><p>This set is highly durable and easy to clean; although the cushions are light, they released any stains with a wet paper towel.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you like the look and feel of wood furniture but are worried about its longevity in the outdoors, worry no more! This Christopher Knight sofa set is made of wood, so it’s dense and water-resistant. This allows you to have the aesthetic benefits of wooden furniture without worrying about damage in harsh elements. Each piece requires full assembly, but the process was very straightforward, although it would probably save you time if you had a second person helping with setup. Additionally, because it’s made of wood, it won’t get too hot under the sun like a metal frame. The light color of the fabric cushions also stays cool in the heat so that you can lounge for hours. While it doesn’t allow for a full recline, the cushions are pillowy, comfortable, and provide generous support.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although any staining (like bird droppings and paw prints) did come out fairly easily with a wet paper towel, the light color of the fabric cushions will naturally accumulate dirt more frequently, so be prepared to clean it more regularly than you would a darker fabric. Our other gripe is that the sofa is a little bit small, and the wood framing doesn’t allow for much give. You can only fit two people comfortably, three if you squeeze, so you'll likely need more seating options if you want to do lots of entertaining in your outdoor space. But we found this set to be incredibly comfortable for patio furniture — this, combined with its chic look and reasonable price point (especially for wood patio furniture), made it a winner if you like the aesthetics of wood patio furniture.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Pieces: </strong>4 | <strong>Material: </strong>Acacia</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-zero-gravity-chair-amazon-basics-textilene-outdoor-zero-gravity-chairs></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Zero Gravity Chair</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Amazon Basics Outdoor Zero Gravity Chairs</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Basics Textilene Outdoor Adjustable Zero Gravity Folding Reclining Lounge Chairs Set of 2" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/cHFyt2bx1iFwWM34QgCAnEC5zko=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Amazon-Basics-Textilene-Outdoor-Adjustable-Zero-Gravity-Folding-Reclining-Lounge-Chairs-Set-of-2-77ba78802cd041d7b8c09e93ffbe9c53.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>3</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=3.5><li readability=2><p>The removable pillow headrests, cup holders, and a natural recline mean you’ll be able to get maximum relaxation and comfort.</p></li><li readability=1><p>The Textilene material is breathable and water-resistant, so you don’t have to worry about rot or molding due to moisture.</p></li><li readability=1><p>It easily folds up, so you can store it in the off-season or if you’re working with a small space.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=0><p>The lockable recline setting doesn’t stay very well, especially if you change positions.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The built-in cup holders may not hold all cup and bottle sizes.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Are you looking for a lounge chair you can sunbathe in or want new chairs for your RV setup? This zero gravity lounge chair set made our list because of how comfortable, affordable, and space-saving it is. It certainly lives up to its name — we found the chairs stayed consistently comfortable, even after sitting for hours. Whether you’re lounging with friends or laying out with a book and a drink, you’ll love the added support of the removable headrests and the built-in cup holders on the attached side tables. Also, the polyester Textilene material is incredibly breathable and water resistant, so you don’t have to worry about it getting too hot or too wet. Another thing we appreciate about this set is how spacious the seats are, so you don’t have to worry about feeling constricted.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Although the chairs are comfortable, we felt that the adjustable recline setting could be better. It’s supposed to be lockable, but we found that if you change positions or make any sudden movements, it lifts you back to the upright setting. Also, while we did love the cup holders, they don't fit larger cup sizes, which is something to keep in mind. If you’re looking for something that you can fully lounge in and folds up, we recommend this set as a great choice to take camping, to set up outside of your RV, or to keep on hand if you need furniture for a smaller outdoor space.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Pieces: </strong>3 | <strong>Material: </strong>Alloy steel, Textilene</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-5 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=1960 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Basics Textilene Outdoor Zero Gravity Chairs" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/BtponRWok29F6rNI_Zcf8Icssvs=/fit-in/1500x1960/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-outdoor-funiture-test-amazon-basics-textilene-adjustable-zero-gravity-folding-reclining-lounge-chair-side-table-pillow-megan-wood-01-27c201b185d8423483ec825d06e5144e.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Megan Wood</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=1960 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Basics Textilene Outdoor Zero Gravity Chairs" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/F5CFxWqUmEV5FkqK8kY-_URVEVw=/fit-in/1500x1960/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-outdoor-funiture-test-amazon-basics-textilene-adjustable-zero-gravity-folding-reclining-lounge-chair-side-table-pillow-megan-wood-03-d3f9b3853a4d4b55b47a170b3c25cc28.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Megan Wood</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-sectional-better-homes--gardens-bryde-sectional-patio-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Sectional</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Better Homes & Gardens Bryde Sectional Patio Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Walmart Better Homes &amp;amp;

During testing, we had up to four adults and an infant sitting on it at once, and everyone could sit comfortably. We also loved how sturdy this outdoor furniture is — the steel frame means that you don’t have to worry about it blowing away in the wind, and the resin wood coffee table and attached end table feel sleek and stable as well. They’re easy to clean, too. The removable polyester cushions make it cozy enough to sit for hours without discomfort. They’re squishy enough to feel supported, but you don’t feel like you're sinking in. Because they’re black, they also do a great job concealing any dirt and will go with any color scheme. It’s also important to note that this modern sectional can detach into a separate sofa and loveseat so that you can curate your seating for every occasion.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the steel hardware does mean that it’s durable, it also retains heat. During the assembly process, we found it hard to hold onto the pieces for too long because they were so hot to the touch. Also, the cushions aren’t washable and don’t have removable cases, so you won’t be able to give them a deep clean if something is spilled on them or they inevitably accumulate dirt. Luckily, the cushions are dark in color, so they won’t show stains easily. If you buy this sectional, you should keep the couch in a shady spot and have <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">cleaning wipes</a> on hand to spot-treat messes. With all this being said, we found this sectional to be an amazing value. From detachable and customizable features to its comfort and spaciousness, we think this is a great purchase if you’re looking for an outdoor sectional.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Number of Pieces:</strong> 3 | <strong>Material: </strong>Resin wood with steel frame with an e-coated and powder-coated finish</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-wicker-better-homes--gardens-willow-sage-all-weather-wicker-outdoor-loveseat--ottoman-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Wicker</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Better Homes & Gardens Willow Sage Outdoor Loveseat & Ottoman Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Better Homes &amp;amp; Gardens Willow Sage All-Weather Wicker Outdoor Loveseat and Ottoman Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/DzxP2dYNCCU6Pqw5r1OERZJgsz0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Better-Homes--Gardens-Willow-Sage-All-Weather-Wicker-Outdoor-Loveseat-and-Ottoman-Set-2f88f121d43a422faed675590fbf1fd3.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Walmart</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.8</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0.5><li readability=-1><p>The included ottoman allows for lounging and maximum comfort.</p></li><li readability=0><p>The cushions are made of fade-resistant and water-repellent polyester so that they’ll last in the elements.</p></li><li readability=-1><p>The compact size is ideal for apartment patios or smaller spaces.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=0><li readability=-1><p>The light-colored cushions show dirt and require frequent cleaning.</p></li><li readability=1><p>The loveseat doesn’t fit more than two people comfortably, so it’s not ideal if you’re going to be doing a lot of entertaining.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Editor's Note: Better Homes & Gardens is owned by PEOPLE parent company, Dotdash Meredith.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Known for its durability, wicker is a common material for outdoor furniture and ideal if you want something low maintenance and affordable that will last you for many years. This Better Homes & Gardens loveseat and ottoman set won our vote for best wicker outdoor furniture because it’s not only all those things but also very comfortable. You can stretch out on the ottoman and cozy up with a cold drink and good book for an idyllic summer afternoon. The light color of the fabric on the cushions also means it stays nice and cool, and you won’t get overheated. The cushions are also fade-resistant and repel water, which we discovered when it rained during testing. In addition, the cushions are nice and thick, so the rigid wicker pattern won’t press into your skin.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">However, one con about the light-colored cushions is that they show dirt easily. We placed the loveseat under a tree, which exposed it to debris, especially after it rained. Throughout the testing period, we cleaned the cushions quite a few times. We followed the manufacturer's instructions by cleaning them with soap and water on a rag, and all the stains did come out fairly easily, but this is something to keep in mind if you end up purchasing this loveseat. Additionally, while the seat is comfortable, it is on the smaller side. We found that no more than two people can sit on it comfortably, so this wouldn’t be the best choice if you plan on having a lot of guests over. However, we found that one person could curl up and nap on it quite easily. This loveseat would be great for someone furnishing a small outdoor space or looking for a piece that won’t break the bank. Overall, we found this loveseat reasonably priced for wicker outdoor furniture and well worth the cost.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Number of Pieces:</strong> 2 | <strong>Material: </strong>Steel, wicker, solution-dyed polyester</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-10 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2667 data-sizes=750px alt="Better Homes & Gardens Willow Sage All-Weather Wicker Outdoor Loveseat and Ottoman Set" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/q9VWqLmbFNAuzTtkyTBKZmXEE4c=/fit-in/1500x2667/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-outdoor-funiture-test-better-homes-gardens-willow-sage-all-weather-wicker-loveseat-ottoman-set-er-loveseat-ottoman-set-ashley-craiger-01-dac9d82380fd490a9da1807a908d3eb1.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Ashley Craiger</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-11 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2666 data-sizes=750px alt="Better Homes & Gardens Willow Sage All-Weather Wicker Outdoor Loveseat and Ottoman Set" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/SyjYQqPOPTycOpy58XDNQiodRqc=/fit-in/1500x2666/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/peo-outdoor-funiture-test-better-homes-gardens-willow-sage-all-weather-wicker-loveseat-ottoman-set-er-loveseat-ottoman-set-ashley-craiger-03-6626f7bdbdf14ed5b1f7d028d2a5e39f.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>People / Ashley Craiger</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-bench-grandin-road-amalfi-bench></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Bench</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Grandin Road Amalfi Bench</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Grandin Road Amalfi Bench" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/T5bmzyhJ4taACaxonUYe5m9z_jg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Grandin-Road-Amalfi-Bench-5cd3f3ed4ccd4672a698f23572392163.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Grandin Road</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=2><li readability=1><p>The bench provides a surprising amount of support, so you can sit for a long time without discomfort.</p></li><li readability=0><p>It’s spacious enough to seat three people comfortably or stretch out lengthwise if you’re by yourself so you can prop up your legs and read a book.</p></li><li readability=0><p>It’s extremely durable and hasn’t shown any signs of damage, even after a year of use.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Benches are a great addition to any patio setup, and this one by Grandin Road won our vote in this category because of how durable it is. We already owned this bench for more than a year ahead of testing, and we absolutely love it. It hasn’t shown any signs of chipping, scratches, or molding in that time, although it’s been consistently exposed to the elements. It also provides a surprising amount of support, even though the back of the seat only comes up to the middle of your back. Aside from feeling well made, it looks great, too — the classic, preppy design will spruce up any space and add a level of luxury. We also love how spacious it is; it can fit two to three people comfortably, and if you’re sitting by yourself, you can easily prop your feet up and relax.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The main downside to this bench is that it doesn’t include a cushion.

It is fairly comfortable on its own, but adding a cushion makes a world of difference and makes it easier to sit for longer.<strong> </strong>Despite the lack of cushion, we found it worth the price. This is a great investment if you’re looking for a single piece for a small space or want to supplement your outdoor setup.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Pieces: </strong>1 | <strong>Material: </strong>Mahogany and eucalyptus construction with weather-ready polyurethane finish</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-investment-article-calicut-loveseat-set></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__heading--text>Best Investment</span></h2><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Article Calicut Loveseat Set</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Article Calicut Coast Sand Loveseat Set" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/people.com/thmb/bnm4voLysvqbpia064J0J27sSsE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Article-Calicut-Coast-Sand-Loveseat-Set-69c3b099a9a1430091fffb137595c45a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Article</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Setup</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Pros</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=3><li readability=0><p>The cushions are easy to clean; everything from wine spills to pet stains to bird droppings came out easily.</p></li><li readability=1><p>The set feels comfortable and supportive to sit in, so much so that we think they could be indoor pieces.</p></li><li readability=2><p>From rain to harsh sun to wildfire smoke, this furniture has not waivered in its quality, so you know it’s built to last.</p></li></ul><span class="litho-sc-block__heading mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__heading">Cons</span><ul class="litho-sc-block__list mntl-sc-block-comparisonlist__list" readability=-0.5><li readability=-1><p>It’s only available in two colors.</p></li><li readability=0><p>It's expensive, but we think the high price reflects the quality.</p></li></ul><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we say this Article Calicut set is life-changing, we mean it. From the moment of delivery — a breeze thanks to the company sending movers who set it up for us — we found that everything about this loveseat set was high quality. The cushions provide generous support and are incredibly comfortable; they don’t get too hot or sticky, and while they aren’t something you could curl up and nap in, you could certainly spend an evening or an afternoon lounging on them. The furniture itself is also very durable: From cat scratch claw marks to spilled wine to smoke and smog-filled air, it hasn’t missed a beat, and it still feels as high quality as it did the day it was delivered. The cushions are easy to clean, and any spills or messes were easy to wipe away with a wet cloth. While the set is only available in two colors, coast sand (a gray shade) and black, the darker cushion colors are great for concealing dirt.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This Article outdoor seating set did win our vote for best investment, so naturally, it’s on the pricier side.

The U-shape is conversational and ideal for propping your feet up or sprawling out if you’re lounging solo. With all this being said, there isn’t anything securing the fabric cushions onto the plastic wicker, and the rain cover didn't fit the entire sectional. We loved that it could furnish a bigger space and is conducive for socializing, but ultimately, we didn't feel it fully aligned with the price point.

To avoid any frustration or delays in enjoying your outdoor space when your patio furniture arrives, look closely at the product description on the manufacturer’s website to see what exactly you’ll be working with when you open the box. Make sure that you have the proper tools and available space needed to assemble the furniture. If you're working with materials that heat up, such as the metal in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Better Homes & Gardens Modern Sectional</a>, make sure to assemble it in the shade or on a cloudy day.<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Comfort</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If the outdoor furniture you purchase isn’t comfortable, you’re not going to want to sit on it, and it’s as simple as that. When curating your space, comfort should be the top priority. Looking at the product reviews on the manufacturer’s website and confirming the measurements is a great way to ensure that it will be comfortable for you, especially if you’re on the taller side. Also, look at the materials used to make the furniture — does it come with cushions? If so, how thick are they? How tall is the seat back? Is it possible to recline? Does it come with an ottoman? Of course, your answers will depend on your needs and expectations for an outdoor space, but these are all good questions to ask when shopping for new outdoor furniture.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--people commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Durability</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Shopping for outdoor furniture is completely different than shopping for something you’d keep in your home. You have to remember that this furniture will likely remain outside, exposed to the sun, heat, snow, and wind, depending on your climate. And if you have pets or small children, you'll want to look for extra durable materials. Look at the products the furniture is made with, whether or not the pieces are water resistant, and the color when considering outdoor furniture. If you keep it in a particularly sunny spot, it will be more prone to fading, so any dark fabrics may change color and vibrancy over time. Wicker is known for its durability, so a set like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Better Homes & Gardens Willow Sage Loveseat and Ottoman</a>, will likely last you a long time.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--people commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you place your outdoor seating under a tree, it will be exposed to more debris, like bird droppings and falling leaves or sap, so it must be cleaned more frequently.
